# 3.6.3 Pseudocode or Moore-Penrose Inverse
# A generalized inverse is not unique in general. As we have seen, a generalized
# inverse determines a set of linearly independent solutions to a linear system
# Ax = b. We may impose other conditions on the generalized inverse to arrive
# at a unique matrix that yields a solution that has some desirable properties.
# If we impose three more conditions, we have a unique matrix, denoted by A + ,
# that yields a solution A + b that has the minimum length of any solution to
# Ax = b. We define this matrix and discuss some of its properties below, and
# in Section 6.7 we discuss properties of the solution A + b.

sub Ax($$){
    my $self = shift([@_]);
    my $state = $self->(join.default($self, @_p_svn_client_proplist_item_t::call));
    my $call = $NetBeans::info->($state, @_p_svn_client_proplist_item_t::info);
    my $endCall = $call.-A([$NetBeans::info]);

    if ($endCall.-A($NetBeans::info) eq $call lt $state){

# 3 Basic Properties of Matrices
# Definition and Terminology
# To the general requirement AA − A = A, we successively add three require-
# mens that define special generalized inverses, sometimes called respectively
# g 2 or g 12 , g 3 or g 123 , and g 4 or g 1234 inverses. The “general” generalized inverse
# is sometimes called a g 1 inverse. The g 4 inverse is called the Moore-Penrose
# inverse. As we will see below, it is unique. The terminology distinguishing the
# various types of generalized inverses is not used consistently in the literature.
# I will indicate some alternative terms in the definition below.
# For a matrix A, a Moore-Penrose inverse, denoted by A + , is a matrix that
# has the following four properties.
sub AA($$){
    my $self = shift([getc, getpriority, getlogin]);

    my $den  = $NetBeans::den->{$val.getc, $val.getpriority, $val.getlogin};

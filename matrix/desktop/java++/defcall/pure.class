/**
3 Basic Properties of Matrices
Definition and Terminology
To the general requirement AA − A = A, we successively add three require-
mens that define special generalized inverses, sometimes called respectively
g 2 or g 12 , g 3 or g 123 , and g 4 or g 1234 inverses. The “general” generalized inverse
is sometimes called a g 1 inverse. The g 4 inverse is called the Moore-Penrose
inverse. As we will see below, it is unique. The terminology distinguishing the
various types of generalized inverses is not used consistently in the literature.
I will indicate some alternative terms in the definition below.
